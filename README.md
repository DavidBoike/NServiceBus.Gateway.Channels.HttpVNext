NServiceBus.Gateway.Channels.HttpVNext
===================
An HTTP channel implementation for NServiceBus.Gateway that doesn't use HTTP Headers for message content or metadata. As such it should be easier to use this channel where headers may be modified (e.g. when a gateway is behind a reverse proxy such as NGINX).
